Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

I found Google GO is a interesting programming language.
I guess, it is very useful in network data mining.
This project is just for a sample to show Go's power.

The best method to learn a new language is to try to teach
others.  So, this project won't show up a finished code 
at once.  Intead, I'll keep the my learning experiences
on **Dummy Days** sections and github.com.

Usage
^^^^^

gonetgrep [options] <keyword> <url> [<url> ...]

Grep keyword in multiple web pages.

Dummy Days
^^^^^^^^^^

This is the section of my experience.

Day 1

Subject: install Go

In fact, I don't like the name of this language.
I would like it named as 'golang' which is more searchable.

I use archlinux.  It is easy::

  yaourt -S go-hg  # Google Go
  yaourt -S gocode-git # suggest strongly for vim users
  # if gocode-git install failed, just forgive it.

Day 2
=====

Subject: compile hello world
